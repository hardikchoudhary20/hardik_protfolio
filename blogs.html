                        The Altered State Machine (ASM) is a decentralized protocol for establishing ownership of an AI agent (a
                        bot) via an NFT (non-fungible token). In Layman's terms, it refers to a platform where one can make
                        trainable AI agents and trade them using NFTs. The idea behind the creation of ASM is to support the new
                        arriving generation of metaverses and gaming, where it would be required to interact with each other
                        using AI agents.                    </p>
